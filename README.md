 EFT - notPro cheat - Internal MonoBehaviour version

So im releasing my old shit, its not optimised, nor working as intended but there are some ideas you can use for your cheat.

**Void-intern - retarded copy pasta**
Copypasta from NoNameCheat... Nothing was changed except next copypasta from Brayden
Its not optimised at all

**MainFolder Cheat**
older version of cheat in folder _TheMaoci-Internal_

**TheMaoci-Internal**
- its still not optimised in my eyes
- got Brayden idea of Vangle aimbot
- Drawing is bugged and returns blackscreen after some time
- it could cause out of memory
- if you are using Optimisations in VS dont use FastMath.cs cause it will be retarded...
- aimbot has troubles with properly selecting target (no vis check)
- whole cheat is lagging the shit out of everything
- Raycast.cs is fucked up dont use it
